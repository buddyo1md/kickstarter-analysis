# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
~~Explain the purpose of this analysis.~~

### Purpose
Louise is committed to creating a play in the U.S. using Kickstarter funding. On behalf of Louise I was asked to do an analysis of an available dataset regarding historical Kickstarter funding campaigns to provide Louise with guidance as to how she can optimize the chances of a successful outcome. In addition, I am to provide her with information speaking to the limitations of this analysis. 

### Background
The data set provided for analysis is a spreadsheet of results of historic Kickstarter funding efforts covering a time period from 8/2009 through 5/2017. It contains 9 discrete Categories (film & video, music, publishing, technology, games, photography, theater, food, and journalism) further broken down into a total of 41 subcategories.  There are a total of 4,114 records with Subcategory total campaign numbers ranging from 20 (10 different sub-categories) to 1,066 (plays, the subcategory of particular interest to Louise). 

Other possibly important attributes of the data include total pledges and number of pledges, country (presumably where the campaign originated), and dates of open/close of the campaigns. 

All told, there are 

## Analysis and Challenges
~~Explain how you performed your analysis using images and links to code, as well as any challenges you encountered and how you overcame them. If you had no challenges, describe any possible challenges or difficulties that could be encountered.~~
