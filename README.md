# An Analysis of Kickstart Campaigns

Headers are signified with a #. The number of hashtags indicates the level of the header. For example, ### is a third-level header.

Bullets are added in three ways: a typical bullet with an asterisk, a numbered bullet with numbers, or a hyphenated bullet with a hyphen.

Images can be added with the following syntax: ![image_name](path/to/image_name.png).

Hyperlinks to relevant files are  added in a similar manner: [filename](path/to/filename.xlxs).

Line breaks are added by using three consecutive hyphens: ---.
