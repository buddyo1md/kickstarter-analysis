# An Analysis of Kickstart Campaigns

This Repository holds the files and workproduct of Dr. Buddy Owen pertinent to the initial Challenge in the University of Texas McCombs School Data Bootcamp. I (Dr. Owen) am still not adept at the use of GIt and thus the organization of these files is very haphazard. I have embarked on a structured learning journey for git using some web-based resources and fully expect that I will develop a much more capable skill set in this and other aspects of participating efficiently and effectively in collaborative analysis, development, and distribution of collaboratie creative efforts. 

Headers are signified with a #. The number of hashtags indicates the level of the header. For example, ### is a third-level header.

Bullets are added in three ways: a typical bullet with an asterisk, a numbered bullet with numbers, or a hyphenated bullet with a hyphen.

Images can be added with the following syntax: ![image_name](path/to/image_name.png).

Hyperlinks to relevant files are  added in a similar manner: [filename](path/to/filename.xlxs).

Line breaks are added by using three consecutive hyphens: ---.
